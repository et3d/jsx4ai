##### JavaScript API for Adobe illustrator cc22
Ai can be customized and improved at various levels. A first user-friendly level of automation is called ACTIONS. To sum up it is basically recording what the mouse can do with some hickups.
Beware though: some functions are not reachable or glitched. To extend the automation scope of the tool, one can use Adobe API called ExtendScript.
Things starts to become interesting as Ai would now react as a Command Line Instrustion. Another bonus would be the Object Language approach as you now manipulate arrays.
There is also a UI tool to improve user feedback. (scripting might freeze Ai during execution)
Some tweaks were necessary to use the Menu-Commands. You could even mix scripting solution.
Warning Ai Actions is unreliable and should be used for making Proof Of Concepts or development builds only.
